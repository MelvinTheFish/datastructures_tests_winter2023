# Tests for Wet1
Currently there are only Unit Tests for the world_cup_t functions

## How to run the Unit Tests
* Clone / Download the files from the repository
* Put the files in the folder with all your other files (makefile and the WorldCup folder)
* Update the makefile file to support your files of the assignment
* In the teminal, located in the folder run:
  * make
  * ./WorldCupUnitTester

## Notes
* It is possible that InOutTests will be published in the next few days - we cannot promise that at this point.
* No tests for the AVLtree will be published since it depends on your specific implementation :)
