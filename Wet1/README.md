# Tests for Wet1
Currently there are only Unit Tests for the world_cup_t functions

## How to run the Unit Tests


## Notes
It is possible that InOutTests will be published in the next few days - we cannot promise that at this point.
No tests for the AVLtree will be published since it depends on your specific implementation :)
